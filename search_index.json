Data collection continues until the end of followup. Two clinical trials on prevention of heart attacks report baseline data on smoking, shown below. In one of these trials, the randomization did not work. Which one, and why? 5.2 Answer Lets see the data first: ## Treatment Control ## Number of people 1012 997 ## Percent who smoked 49.3% 69% ## Treatment Control ## Number of people 995 1017 ## Percent who smoked 59.3% 59% As said in the question - the data should show an equal amount of smokers in each group (treatment and control), in order to have an un-biased experiment. As we cann see in the second trial - the percent of smokers in each group is similar (59.3% in the treatment group, 59.3% in the control group), but in the first trial - there are more smokers (69%) in the control group than in the treatment group (49.3%). The difference in the first trial can cause a bias - smoking might have an effect on the reaction to the treatment or general condition. A good randomization process will result in groups with similar rates of smokers (like the second trial), but the randomization process of the first trial did not work properly and produced a higher rate of smokers in the control group.
